This project involves the design and implementation of an air floating testbed to simulate microgravity conditions for
space debris capture experiments. The testbed utilizes a low-friction surface and air bearing to create a
near-gravityless environment, allowing researchers to study the dynamics of debris capture mechanisms in a controlled
setting.
