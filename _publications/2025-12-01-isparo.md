Knowing the inertia parameters of a grasped object is crucial for dynamics-aware manipulation, especially in space robotics with free-floating bases. This work addresses the problem of estimating the inertia parameters of an unknown target object during manipulation. We apply and extend an existing online identification method by incorporating momentum conservation, enabling its use for the floating-base robots. The proposed method is validated through numerical simulations, and the estimated parameters are compared with ground-truth values. Results demonstrate accurate identification in the scenarios, highlighting the methodâ€™s applicability to on-orbit servicing and other space missions.
