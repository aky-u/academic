Thank you for visiting my personal website, where I share my academic journey, projects, and interests.

I am Akiyoshi Uchida, a Masterâ€™s student in Space Robotics LAb (SRL) at Tohoku University, Japan.
My research focuses on dynamics modeling, identification, and control of free-floating space robots, with applications to on-orbit servicing.
I completed a 10-month research internship at the SpaceR Laboratory, University of Luxembourg, where I developed a floating platform and conducted both simulation and ground experiments on robotic motion in microgravity environments.
My work has been recognized with the Best Paper Award at the 2024 International Conference on Space Robotics (iSpaRo).
I am particularly interested in advanced control, dynamics, and machine learning approaches for space robotics, aiming to contribute to future on-orbit servicing and debris removal missions.
